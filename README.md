# JOBS WISHLIST
## -Vinay Kumar Dahiya

## Introduction

How many times has it occurred that you have a specific company in mind to apply? You keep waiting and waiting for it to post job openings for your desired profile, but it slips your attention when the post is finally made, or maybe you simply miss because you didn't know there was an opening in the first place. Perhaps you did apply if you were very observant and lucky.
But what if all this effort and frustration that you experinced could be avoided. What if you could simply create a wishlist for the job profile you are interested in, select the companies to watch and just wait and be notified as soon as the job post has been made.
Meanwhile be you can view the suggestions for company/profile based on what similar users have selected, apply if you want to or simply wait to be notified.

The end user being job aspirant like college students or freshers, even can be used by experienced professionals
